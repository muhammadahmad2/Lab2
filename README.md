# Lab2
Put your name next to something on the todo list so we know you're working on it. Then do it. When you're done, move it to the done list.

## DONE
- clr
- dir - could stand to be alphabetized
- echo
- quit
- tokenizing
- pause
- cd
- environment variable *shell* = the file path of the shell executable
- help - print 'readme' using **more** filter
- batch file input (a la *myshell batchfile*)
- I/O redirection? (apparently(?))
- beef up operators manual (*readme*)

## TODO
- environ - should list environment variables specific to our shell (i think) - SHELL is not added to variables
- make makefile create **myshell** instead of **myshell.exe**
- code cleanup
- executing programs in the shell (Not required)
