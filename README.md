# Lab2
Put your name next to something on the todo list so we know you're working on it. Then do it. When you're done, move it to the done list.

## DONE
- clr
- dir - could stand to be alphabetized
- echo
- quit
- tokenizing
- pause
- cd
- environment variable *shell* = the file path of the shell executable

## TODO
- environ - should list environment variables specific to our shell (i think)
- environ needs to be called from main
- help - print 'readme' using **more** filter
- executing programs in the shell (I think that's what **2** is asking for)
- batch file input (a la *myshell batchfile*)
- more info in *readme* - operators manual
- deliverables as outlined in **Lab2.pdf**
- parts **4-6** (for bonus or due Oct 30 (?))
