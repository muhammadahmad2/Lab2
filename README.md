# Lab2
I think everything is finished

## DONE
- clr
- dir - could stand to be alphabetized
- echo
- quit
- tokenizing
- pause
- cd
- environment variable *shell* = the file path of the shell executable
- help - print 'readme' using **more** filter
- batch file input (a la *myshell batchfile*)
- I/O redirection? (apparently(?))
- beef up operators manual (*readme*)
- environ 

## TODO

- make makefile create **myshell** instead of **myshell.exe** - difficult to do with the current makefile - probably not important
- code cleanup
- executing programs in the shell (Not required)
